<p><strong>Compound Interest</strong> is calculated on the principle which is re-calculated per term.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, Sue deposits $500.00 into her savings account with a compound interest rate of 10%. If interest is
    calculated annually, after one year she would have gained $25.00 in interest, leaving her with an account balance
of $525.00</p>
